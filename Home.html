        <h2><center>The Basics</center></h2>
        <p>
            <center>
    The basics of financial literacy begins with budgeting. Everything revolves around budgeting as it is <br>
    very useful for financial success. Starting with a budget helps manage your money efficiently and helps<br>
    plan towards a goal. First, you would consider how much you earn, and with that construct a list of expenses<br>
    and write out how much they cost. Then you would constuct another list of other expenses such as shopping and <br>
    entertainment, then strategize how much you are willing to spend, however still having money to save. After <br>
    determining how much you are spending on expenses, consider the surplus and set aside a good portion or what <br>
    ever you can to your savings. Try to keep budegting and saving a habit and keep it consistant.

    Another aspect of financial literacy is saving money. Saving money is important when it comes to things like emergencies<br>
    and financial goals. Saving goes along with budegeting, it is something that needs to be a habit and is something<br>
    that needs to be consistant. With consistancy comes gains and accomplishments that will lead you to your financial<br>
    dreams. When deciding how much you should start saving for a particular goal, consider time, budget, and surplus.  <br>
    While working toward a financial  or any goal, considering time is crucial, as it determines how long it takes until<br>
    it reaches success. This helps with planning even bigger goals that may come up in the future. With this, acknowledging<br>
    a budget is also pivotal because a budget plans out your spendings. When having a set plan on spendings, considering<br>
    the surplus and decide how much is needed and how much can be put away toward savings. Having a savings plan is very <br>
    important because there will be times in life where you don't know what may come next or what may come up and in those <br>
    types of situations, having money to be able to fall back on can be extremely helpful.
